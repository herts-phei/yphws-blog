This blog website provides short reports on analysis done around the [Young People's Health and Well-being Survey](https://www.hertshealthevidence.org/yphws/yphws.aspx) (YPHWS), a youth health and wellbeing survey which gathers self-reported information annually from those aged 11-19 in Hertfordshire. The survey in a funded by Hertfordshire County Council's Public Health and Services for Young People teams and is run by the Public Health Evidence & Intelligence Team.

We aim to release these reports iteratively over time.

Some of the initial questions we aim to tackle include, but are not limited to:

-   Do young people in care have less healthy diets than those not in care?
-   Do young people in care have worse awareness of MH services than those not in care?
-   Do LGBTQ+ YP have different aspirations for their future? ✔
-   Do YP in care have different aspirations for their future? ✔
-   Do LGBTQ+ YP feel different about sustainability?
-   Do LGBTQ+ YP have different experiences in relation to safety and crime?
-   Are YP who take drugs more likely to have MH conditions? ✔
-   Are those with disabilities supported by their schools and do they have different aspirations?
-   Is self-perceived weight associated with poorer diet and lower exercise?
-   Are more deprived YP more likely to smoke and vape? How do diet, self perceived weight, activity correlate with NCMP at a school level
