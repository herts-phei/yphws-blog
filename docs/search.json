The survey in a funded by Hertfordshire County Council’s Public Health and Services for Young People teams and is run by the Public Health Evidence & Intelligence Team.\nWe aim to release these reports iteratively over time.\nSome of the initial questions we aim to tackle include, but are not limited to:\n\nDo young people in care have less healthy diets than those not in care?\nDo young people in care have worse awareness of MH services than those not in care?\nDo LGBTQ+ YP have different aspirations for their future? ✔\nDo YP in care have different aspirations for their future? ✔\nDo LGBTQ+ YP feel different about sustainability?\nDo LGBTQ+ YP have different experiences in relation to safety and crime?\nAre YP who take drugs more likely to have MH conditions? ✔\nAre those with disabilities supported by their schools and do they have different aspirations?\nIs self-perceived weight associated with poorer diet and lower exercise?\nAre more deprived YP more likely to smoke and vape? How do diet, self perceived weight, activity correlate with NCMP at a school level\n\nFor any queries related to using the website or on the analyses please contact us at: PH Intelligence\n\nWhat’s New?\n\n2023-06-15 - Do YP in care have different aspirations for their future?"

Note, these numbers have been suppressed to the nearest 5 to prevent disclosure, but the actual chi-squared tests have been performed on the raw numbers.\nFor the purposes of this analysis, students who answered undecided/questioning and other are grouped together with students who answered gay, lesbian or bisexual. Students who answered prefer not to say were excluded, owing to the large difference in responses between this category and the other relevant categories.\n\n\n\nMore on chi-squared tests\n\nWe can put the results of students answering the question in YPHWS in a contingency table, which tallies the responses into a table like:\n\n\n\nCare-experienced\nMaybe\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith contingency tables, we can perform chi-square tests, which examines whether the categories of the rows and columns of a contingency table are statistically significantly associated.\nThe chi-squared test compares the observed frequencies from the data with expected frequencies if there were null or no relationship between the variables.\nWith chi-squared tests, we need sufficient size in each of the cells inside the table. While the number of students not care-experienced outnumber the number of students who answered prefer not to say or yes, there are still sufficient numbers to perform the test (>5) in each of the responses.\nAfter the critical chi-squared test value is calculated, we then use the degrees of freedom to match the results on a distribution table with a significance threshold to determine statistical significance, usually set at 0.05.

Further educational pursuits after school are highly associated with better health outcomes, lower deprivation, and higher earnings potential in adulthood.

    "text": "Methods\nTo investigate links between drug use and issues related to mental health, logistic regression is used. This is a form of regression analysis where the response variable is binary (i.e. Yes/No). From the logistic regression, we can evaluate what predictors have an effect on the outcome of the response variable, whilst we can also compare the predictability between explanatory variables using an odds ratio.\nIn the following, we treat accessing mental health as the response variable, meaning only individuals who claim they categorically did or did not access mental health services are included in the analysis.\nIn the following report we assess how drugs relate to:\n\nWorrying about mental health;\nSkipping school due to mental health;\nNeeding mental health services;\nHaving mental health conditions.\n\nThe analysis does not confirm causation. Predictors can only be linked to response variables (particularly if they are significant). It cannot be said for certain whether the predictor causes the response.\nIn some of the examples below, there are graphical representations of the logistic regression analysis and odds ratio outputs. In these graphs, there is a baseline group in which other groups are compared against (baselines are clarified in the examples), from which groups can be claimed to be more or less likely to have a certain characteristic (e.g. to have a mental health condition). Each group has an associated confidence interval, in which we can be 95% certain the real value lies in. Groups can be determined to be significantly different from one another if the intervals do not overlap, or the baseline group does not fall within the groups interval.\nA statistically significant relationship between the explanatory and response variables is outlined when the p-value is lower than the 0.05 threshold. In this case, the p-value is small enough to reject the null hypothesis of the conducted test, which is that there is no relationship between the variables."

    "text": "Results\n\n\n\nA total of 765 students in this analysis claimed to have taken drugs. After conducting a logistic regression analysis having controlled for sex and age, it was found that:\n\nStudents who claimed to have taken drugs are 1.39 times more likely to be worried about their mental health than students who did not take drugs. This association is significant (p-value < 0.05).\nStudents who claimed to have taken drugs are 2.88 times more likely to skip school due to mental health reasons than students who did not take drugs. This association is significant (p-value < 0.05).\nStudents who claimed to have taken drugs are 2.49 times more likely to access mental health services than students who did not take drugs. This association is significant (p-value < 0.05).\nStudents who claimed to have taken drugs are 3.97 times more likely to have a mental health condition than students who did not take drugs. This association is significant (p-value < 0.05).\n\n\n\nIs there an association between gender, drugs and mental health conditions?\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the baseline of males who have not taken drugs, males who have taken drugs are 2.8 times more likely to have a mental health condition. Among those who have claimed to have taken drugs, females are 4.19 times more likely than males to have a mental health condition, a significant difference. Females who have taken drugs are 3.84 times more likely to have a mental health condition than males who have not taken drugs.\n\n\n\nIs there an association between deprivation and mental health conditions?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor individuals who have claimed to have taken drugs, the likelihood of having a mental health condition is lowest for those residing in IMD quintile 2 (most deprived). However, the differences between each quintile are not significant.\n\n\n\nIs there an association between district of residence and mental health conditions?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor individuals who have claimed to have taken drugs, the likelihood of having mental health condition is lowest for those residing in East Hertfordshire. However, the differences between each district are not significant."

    "text": "Conclusions/implications\nIn this report, we highlight that there is a significant link between drug use and an individual’s mental health. Young people who take drugs are more likely to worry about their mental health. This is a cause for concern as drug use is often conducted in order to suppress mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. Young people who take drugs are also more likely to skip school due to mental health issues, which in turn will potentially affect their education in the short and long term. Students with zero absence are 10 times more likely to achieve the English Baccalaureate than those who miss 15%-20% of their school year. Despite these findings, it cannot be said for certain whether drug use causes issues that arise with mental health, it can only be claimed there is a link between the two variables."
