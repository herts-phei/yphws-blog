    "text": "Abstract\nYoung people are at greater risk of alcohol-related harm than adults, and excessive alcohol use during the teenage years is related to a range of health and social problems later in life. We analysed the relationship between a student’s propensity to binge drink to mental health outcomes, namely self-harming when students were asked how they coped with difficult situations, and a question pertaining to life satisfaction.\nIn the data collected for the latest YPHWS cohort, there were 0 students out of a total of 11151 students who answered the question How often do you have six or more drinks on one occasion?. The breakdown of the responses is shown in the table below:\n\n\n\nanswer\nnumber\n%\n\n\n\n\nDaily or almost daily\n60\n2.0\n\n\nWeekly\n850\n28.4\n\n\nLess than monthly\n405\n13.5\n\n\nMonthly\n1565\n52.3\n\n\nNever\n115\n3.8\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\nThrough YPHWS, we asked questions pertaining to patterns of alcohol consumption, and can look at how these answers relate to mental health outcomes. One question asked students how often do you have six or more drinks on one occasion?? This question acts as a proxy for the definition of binge drinking, with the number of units or drinks exactly defining binge drinking being slightly different depending on the source, but is usually defined by six units of alcohol for women and eight units for men in a single day as binge drinking, as seen in the government’s alcohol strategy.\nFor mental health outcomes, we look at students’ responses for by self-harm to the question If you have a problem that worries you how do you cope? with the response being either a binary yes or no. As well, we will look at students’ responses towards questions pertaining to life satisfaction and hopelessness, which allowed students to choose from : low, medium, high, or very high.\nFor the analysis on frequency of binge drinking and propensity to self-harm to cope, we perform a simple logistic regression given the binary response variable. This is a form of regression analysis where the response variable is binary (i.e. Yes/No). From the logistic regression, we can evaluate what predictors have an effect on the outcome of the response variable, whilst we can also compare the predictability between explanatory variables using an odds ratio.\nAs the response variable for life satisfaction has more than two (i.e non-binary) choices, we instead perform a chi-squared test for this part of the analysis.\n\n\nDetails\n\nThe analysis does not confirm causation. Predictors can only be linked to response variables (particularly if they are significant). It cannot be said for certain whether the predictor causes the response.\nIn the table below, there is a baseline group in which other groups are compared against (baselines are clarified in the examples), from which groups can be claimed to be more or less likely to have a certain characteristic (e.g. to have a mental health condition). Each group has an associated confidence interval, in which we can be 95% certain the real value lies in. Groups can be determined to be significantly different from one another if the intervals do not overlap, or the baseline group does not fall within the groups interval.\nA statistically significant relationship between the explanatory and response variables is outlined when the p-value is lower than the 0.05 threshold. In this case, the p-value is small enough to reject the null hypothesis of the conducted test, which is that there is no relationship between the variables.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nSelf-Harm\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results showed that:\n\nStudents who binge drink less than monthly are 1.4 more likely to self-harm compared to those who never binge drink. This is statistically significant.\nStudents who binge drink around once a month are 1.4 more likely to self-harm compared to those who never binge drink. This is not statistically significant.\nStudents who binge drink weekly are 1.4 more likely to self-harm compared to those who never binge drink. This is statistically significant.\nStudents who binge drink daily or almost daily are 1.4 more likely to self-harm compared to those who never binge drink. This is statistically significant.\n\n\n\nResults tabulated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Characteristic\n      OR1\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    alcohol_6more\n\n\n\n        Never\n—\n—\n\n        Less than monthly\n1.43\n1.08, 1.87\n0.011\n        Monthly\n1.36\n0.94, 1.96\n0.10\n        Weekly\n2.95\n1.71, 4.95\n<0.001\n        Daily or almost daily\n10.8\n4.90, 24.3\n<0.001\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 OR = Odds Ratio, CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Satisfaction\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStudents' responses to how satisfied they are with their life\n\n  \n    How often you have 6+drinks in one setting \n    low \n    medium \n    high \n    very high \n  \n \n\n  \n    Never \n    24 \n    25 \n    36 \n    15 \n  \n  \n    Less than monthly \n    28 \n    30 \n    33 \n    9 \n  \n  \n    Monthly \n    28 \n    33 \n    29 \n    10 \n  \n  \n    Weekly \n    38 \n    19 \n    27 \n    15 \n  \n  \n    Daily or almost daily \n    77 \n    7 \n    5 \n    11"

This can be useful for stakeholders involved in the career development of high school students; factors such as diversity and inclusiveness in the workplace, workplace hostility, the costs of self-identity disclosure, self-identity confusion, and inadequate career counselling and guidance services need to be accounted for when considering differences between LGBQ+ and non LGBQ+ students.\n\n\nMore on the results\n\n Below shows the chi-square tests applied to the contingency tables collated together:\n\n\n\n\nquestion\nx^2\np.value\n\n\n\n\neducation\n5.73\n0.06\n\n\njob\n35.66\n0.00\n\n\ntraining\n58.18\n0.00\n\n\nfamily\n0.24\n0.89\n\n\nunsure\n52.02\n0.00\n\n\nother\n0.24\n0.89\n\n\n\n\nA p.value of less than 0.05 indicates statistical significance, and that there is a relationship between the student’s LGBTQ+ label and the specific prospect response.\nA chi-squared test is a simple nonparametric test which only tells us of an association if statistical significance is found.

    "text": "Conclusions/implications\nHere, we identify that the students being looked after status has a very statistically significant effect with continuing education, and no significance with any other pathway after leaving school.\nDespite only having one pathway with statistical significance, this is noteworthy in that it can provide carers, teachers, and others involved in the health and wellbeing of care-experienced CYPs an avenue in monitoring potential shortcomings of a care-experienced CYP’s potential. Further educational pursuits after school are highly associated with better health outcomes, lower deprivation, and higher earnings potential in adulthood. Reducing these inequities to access to higher education or other further educational pursuits is a key element to public health policy.\n\n\nMore on the results\n\n Below shows the chi-square tests applied to the contingency tables collated together:\n\n\n\n\nquestion\nx^2\np.value\n\n\n\n\neducation\n51.56\n0.00\n\n\njob\n4.46\n0.11\n\n\ntraining\n2.62\n0.27\n\n\nfamily\n2.01\n0.37\n\n\nunsure\n1.69\n0.43\n\n\nother\n2.01\n0.37\n\n\n\n\nA p.value of less than 0.05 indicates statistical significance, and that there is a relationship between the student’s status of being looked after and the specific prospect response.\nA chi-squared test is a simple nonparametric test which only tells us of an association if statistical significance is found. Further analyses can be performed to elucidate further details on how or why the relationship between a children being looked after affects their prospective choices after education, but these are beyond the scope of this report."

This is a form of regression analysis where the response variable is binary (i.e. Yes/No). From the logistic regression, we can evaluate what predictors have an effect on the outcome of the response variable, whilst we can also compare the predictability between explanatory variables using an odds ratio.\nIn the following, we treat accessing mental health as the response variable, meaning only individuals who claim they categorically did or did not access mental health services are included in the analysis.\nIn the following report we assess how drugs relate to:\n\nWorrying about mental health;\nSkipping school due to mental health;\nNeeding mental health services;\nHaving mental health conditions.\n\nThe analysis does not confirm causation. Predictors can only be linked to response variables (particularly if they are significant). It cannot be said for certain whether the predictor causes the response.\nIn some of the examples below, there are graphical representations of the logistic regression analysis and odds ratio outputs. In these graphs, there is a baseline group in which other groups are compared against (baselines are clarified in the examples), from which groups can be claimed to be more or less likely to have a certain characteristic (e.g. to have a mental health condition). Each group has an associated confidence interval, in which we can be 95% certain the real value lies in. Groups can be determined to be significantly different from one another if the intervals do not overlap, or the baseline group does not fall within the groups interval.\nA statistically significant relationship between the explanatory and response variables is outlined when the p-value is lower than the 0.05 threshold. In this case, the p-value is small enough to reject the null hypothesis of the conducted test, which is that there is no relationship between the variables."

    "text": "Conclusions/implications\nIn this report, we highlight that there is a significant link between drug use and an individual’s mental health. Young people who take drugs are more likely to worry about their mental health. This is a cause for concern as drug use is often conducted in order to suppress mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. Young people who take drugs are also more likely to skip school due to mental health issues, which in turn will potentially affect their education in the short and long term. Students with zero absence are 10 times more likely to achieve the English Baccalaureate than those who miss 15%-20% of their school year. Despite these findings, it cannot be said for certain whether drug use causes issues that arise with mental health, it can only be claimed there is a link between the two variables."

    "section": "Methods",
    "text": "Methods\nThrough YPHWS, we asked questions pertaining to patterns of alcohol consumption, and can look at how these answers relate to mental health outcomes. One question asked students how often do you have six or more drinks on one occasion?? This question acts as a proxy for the definition of binge drinking, with the number of units or drinks exactly defining binge drinking being slightly different depending on the source, but is usually defined by six units of alcohol for women and eight units for men in a single day as binge drinking, as seen in the government’s alcohol strategy.\nFor mental health outcomes, we look at students’ responses for by self-harm to the question If you have a problem that worries you how do you cope? with the response being either a binary yes or no. As well, we will look at students’ responses towards questions pertaining to life satisfaction and hopelessness, which allowed students to choose from : low, medium, high, or very high.\nFor the analysis on frequency of binge drinking and propensity to self-harm to cope, we perform a simple logistic regression given the binary response variable. This is a form of regression analysis where the response variable is binary (i.e. Yes/No). From the logistic regression, we can evaluate what predictors have an effect on the outcome of the response variable, whilst we can also compare the predictability between explanatory variables using an odds ratio.\nAs the response variable for life satisfaction has more than two (i.e non-binary) choices, we instead perform a chi-squared test for this part of the analysis.\n\n\nAdditional details on the methodology\n\n The analysis does not confirm causation. Predictors can only be linked to response variables (particularly if they are significant). It cannot be said for certain whether the predictor causes the response.\nIn the table below, there is a baseline group in which other groups are compared against (baselines are clarified in the examples), from which groups can be claimed to be more or less likely to have a certain characteristic (e.g. to have a mental health condition).

    "text": "Conclusions\nThese results highlight the relationship of two negative mental health outcomes: propensity to self harm as a coping mechanism and quality of life satisfaction in relation to binge drinking. Not only are these recognised biological and physiological health risks with regards to binge drinking, but this can extend towards psychiatric health issues as well.\nAdolescence is a critical period of risk for binge drinking, and is often the period where many start the behaviour. Targeting the at-risk population of student binge-drinkers should be a core component of CYP public health strategy. The transition from adolescence to young adulthood is a critical developmental period, and encouraging at risk students to reduce alcohol consumption can reduce incidence of many harmful patterns of alcohol use and associated negative externalities in young adulthood, and can reduce attendances to A&E departments and hospitalisations for alcohol-related conditions."
