The survey in a funded by Hertfordshire County Council’s Public Health and Services for Young People teams and is run by the Public Health Evidence & Intelligence Team.\nWe aim to release these reports iteratively over time.\nSome of the initial questions we aim to tackle include, but are not limited to:\n\nDo young people in care have less healthy diets than those not in care?\nDo young people in care have worse awareness of MH services than those not in care?\nDo LGBTQ+ YP have different aspirations for their future? ✔\nDo YP in care have different aspirations for their future? ✔\nDo LGBTQ+ YP feel different about sustainability?\nDo LGBTQ+ YP have different experiences in relation to safety and crime?\nAre YP who take drugs more likely to have MH conditions? ✔\nAre those with disabilities supported by their schools and do they have different aspirations?\nIs self-perceived weight associated with poorer diet and lower exercise? ✔\nAre more deprived YP more likely to smoke and vape? How do diet, self perceived weight, activity correlate with NCMP at a school level\n\nFor any queries related to using the website or on the analyses please contact us at: PH Intelligence\n\nWhat’s New?\n\n2023-06-15 - Do YP in care have different aspirations for their future?"

    "text": "Methods\nTo investigate links between drug use and issues related to mental health, logistic regression is used. This is a form of regression analysis where the response variable is binary (i.e. Yes/No). From the logistic regression, we can evaluate what predictors have an effect on the outcome of the response variable, whilst we can also compare the predictability between explanatory variables using an odds ratio.\nIn the following, we treat accessing mental health as the response variable, meaning only individuals who claim they categorically did or did not access mental health services are included in the analysis.\nIn the following report we assess how drugs relate to:\n\nWorrying about mental health;\nSkipping school due to mental health;\nNeeding mental health services;\nHaving mental health conditions.\n\nThe analysis does not confirm causation. Predictors can only be linked to response variables (particularly if they are significant). It cannot be said for certain whether the predictor causes the response.\nIn some of the examples below, there are graphical representations of the logistic regression analysis and odds ratio outputs. In these graphs, there is a baseline group in which other groups are compared against (baselines are clarified in the examples), from which groups can be claimed to be more or less likely to have a certain characteristic (e.g. to have a mental health condition). Each group has an associated confidence interval, in which we can be 95% certain the real value lies in. Groups can be determined to be significantly different from one another if the intervals do not overlap, or the baseline group does not fall within the groups interval.\nA statistically significant relationship between the explanatory and response variables is outlined when the p-value is lower than the 0.05 threshold. In this case, the p-value is small enough to reject the null hypothesis of the conducted test, which is that there is no relationship between the variables."

Among those who have claimed to have taken drugs, females are 4.19 times more likely than males to have a mental health condition, a significant difference.

However, the differences between each quintile are not significant.\n\n\n\nIs there an association between district of residence and mental health conditions?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor individuals who have claimed to have taken drugs, the likelihood of having mental health condition is lowest for those residing in East Hertfordshire.

    "text": "Conclusions/implications\nIn this report, we highlight that there is a significant link between drug use and an individual’s mental health. Young people who take drugs are more likely to worry about their mental health. This is a cause for concern as drug use is often conducted in order to suppress mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. Young people who take drugs are also more likely to skip school due to mental health issues, which in turn will potentially affect their education in the short and long term. Students with zero absence are 10 times more likely to achieve the English Baccalaureate than those who miss 15%-20% of their school year. Despite these findings, it cannot be said for certain whether drug use causes issues that arise with mental health, it can only be claimed there is a link between the two variables."

This could influence their decision-making around aspirations after leaving school, such as their career, education, or training. This brief analysis seeks to ascertain whether a student’s care status has a relationship with their aspirations after school.\nIn the data collected for the latest YPHWS cohort, there were 255 students out of a total of 11151 students who are care-experienced CYPs, representing 2.3% of the total student population.\nHere, we identify that the students being looked after status has a very statistically significant relationship with continuing education, but with no statistical significance with any of the other pathways after school."

    "text": "Conclusions/implications\nWe identify that whether a student is straight/heterosexual or part of the LGBQ+ group has a very statistically significant effect with plans to get a job after leaving school, plans to pursue training, and uncertainty with what to do.\nThese results are noteworthy as they highlight that differences in certain students’ aspirational pathways can be influenced by their sexual orientation. This can be useful for stakeholders involved in the career development of high school students; factors such as diversity and inclusiveness in the workplace, workplace hostility, the costs of self-identity disclosure, self-identity confusion, and inadequate career counselling and guidance services need to be accounted for when considering differences between LGBQ+ and non LGBQ+ students.\n\n\nMore on the results\n\n Below shows the chi-square tests applied to the contingency tables collated together:\n\n\n\n\nquestion\nx^2\np.value\n\n\n\n\neducation\n5.73\n0.06\n\n\njob\n35.66\n0.00\n\n\ntraining\n58.18\n0.00\n\n\nfamily\n0.24\n0.89\n\n\nunsure\n52.02\n0.00\n\n\nother\n0.24\n0.89\n\n\n\n\nA p.value of less than 0.05 indicates statistical significance, and that there is a relationship between the student’s LGBTQ+ label and the specific prospect response.\nA chi-squared test is a simple nonparametric test which only tells us of an association if statistical significance is found. Further analyses can be performed to elucidate further details on how or why the relationship between a student’s sexual orientation affects their decision for pursuing a job after leaving school, training, and uncertainty with what to do, but these are beyond the scope of this report."

    "text": "Sub-analysis on transgender students\nThe crux of this analysis focuses on the sexual orientation of students, which is separate from that of biological sex. For the 2022 release of YPHWS, the survey redefined the question on biological sex to one around gender identity, which expanded the number of options available, allowing students to tick non-binary and transgender as responses.\nThese populations have received an increased of amount of news coverage in recent years, and research has shown they have differing health experiences and sociological outcomes. As a result, we performed an additional analysis on the non-binary and transgender population, with identical methodology as we have done those of LGBQ+ students above.\n\nSub-analysis results\n\n\nTable 6: Summary count of students on question asking about biological sex in YPHWS\n\n\nanswer\nnumber\n%\n\n\n\n\nFemale\n5415\n48.6\n\n\nMale\n4490\n40.3\n\n\nNon-Binary\n150\n1.3\n\n\nOther\n90\n0.8\n\n\nPrefer not to say\n110\n1.0\n\n\nTransgender\n120\n1.1\n\n\n\n\nGiven relatively small numbers of the non-binary and transgender student population, these two categories were pooled together.

    "section": "Methods",
    "text": "Methods\nThrough YPHWS, we asked questions pertaining to patterns of alcohol consumption, and can look at how these answers relate to mental health outcomes. One question asked students how often do you have six or more drinks on one occasion? This question acts as a proxy for the definition of binge drinking, with the number of units or drinks exactly defining binge drinking being slightly different depending on the source, but is usually defined by six units of alcohol for women and eight units for men in a single day as binge drinking, as seen in the government’s alcohol strategy.\nFor mental health outcomes, we look at students’ responses for by self-harm to the question “If you have a problem that worries you how do you cope?“ with the response being either a binary yes or no. As well, we will look at students’ responses towards questions pertaining to life satisfaction and hopelessness, which allowed students to choose from : low, medium, high, or very high.\nFor the analysis on frequency of binge drinking and propensity to self-harm to cope, we perform a simple logistic regression given the binary response variable. This is a form of regression analysis where the response variable is binary (i.e. Yes/No). From the logistic regression, we can evaluate what predictors have an effect on the outcome of the response variable, whilst we can also compare the predictability between explanatory variables using an odds ratio.\nAs the response variable for life satisfaction has more than two (i.e non-binary) choices, we instead perform a chi-squared test for this part of the analysis.\n\n\nAdditional details on the methodology\n\n The analysis does not confirm causation. Predictors can only be linked to response variables (particularly if they are significant). It cannot be said for certain whether the predictor causes the response.\nIn the table below, there is a baseline group in which other groups are compared against (baselines are clarified in the examples), from which groups can be claimed to be more or less likely to have a certain characteristic (e.g. to have a mental health condition). Each group has an associated confidence interval, in which we can be 95% certain the real value lies in. Groups can be determined to be significantly different from one another if the intervals do not overlap, or the baseline group does not fall within the groups interval.\nA statistically significant relationship between the explanatory and response variables is outlined when the p-value is lower than the 0.05 threshold. In this case, the p-value is small enough to reject the null hypothesis of the conducted test, which is that there is no relationship between the variables."

    "text": "Conclusions\nThese results highlight the relationship of two negative mental health outcomes: propensity to self harm as a coping mechanism and quality of life satisfaction in relation to binge drinking. Not only are these recognised biological and physiological health risks with regards to binge drinking, but this can extend towards psychiatric health issues as well.\nAdolescence is a critical period of risk for binge drinking, and is often the period where many start the behaviour. Targeting the at-risk population of student binge-drinkers should be a core component of CYP public health strategy. The transition from adolescence to young adulthood is a critical developmental period, and encouraging at risk students to reduce alcohol consumption can reduce incidence of many harmful patterns of alcohol use and associated negative externalities in young adulthood, and can reduce attendances to A&E departments and hospitalisations for alcohol-related conditions."
