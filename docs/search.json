    "text": "Methods\nOne of the questions coded in the YPHWS survey is what do you plan to do as a next step after leaving school? This is a multi-factorial answer, where students can respond either yes, no, or maybe to several options:\n\nEducation\nJob\nTraining\nFamily\nUncertain\nOther\n\nWe performed a chi-squared test for each of the different prospects questions on the tables below for each of the responses, along with their relative proportions. Note, these numbers have been suppressed to the nearest 5 to prevent disclosure, but the actual chi-squared tests have been performed on the raw numbers.\n\n\n\nMore on chi-squared tests\n\nWe can put the results of students answering the question in YPHWS in a contingency table, which tallies the responses into a table like:\n\n\n\nCare-experienced\nMaybe\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith contingency tables, we can perform chi-square tests, which examines whether the categories of the rows and columns of a contingency table are statistically significantly associated.\nThe chi-squared test compares the observed frequencies from the data with expected frequencies if there were null or no relationship between the variables.\nWith chi-squared tests, we need sufficient size in each of the cells inside the table. While the number of students not care-experienced outnumber the number of students who answered prefer not to say or yes, there are still sufficient numbers to perform the test (>5) in each of the responses.\nAfter the critical chi-squared test value is calculated, we then use the degrees of freedom to match the results on a distribution table with a significance threshold to determine statistical significance, usually set at 0.05. More about chi-squared tests can be found at: …\n\n\n\nWarning: Using an external vector in selections was deprecated in tidyselect 1.1.0.\nℹ Please use `all_of()` or `any_of()` instead.\n  # Was:\n  data %>% select(column)\n\n  # Now:\n  data %>% select(all_of(column))\n\nSee <https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/faq-external-vector.html>."

    "text": "Conclusions/implications\nHere, we identify that the students being looked after status has a very statistically significant effect with continuing education, and no significance with any other pathway after leaving school.\nDespite only having one pathway with statistical significance, this is noteworthy in that it can provide carers, teachers, and others involved in the health and wellbeing of care-experienced CYPs an avenue in monitoring potential shortcomings of a care-experienced CYP’s potential. Further educational pursuits after school are highly associated with better health outcomes, lower deprivation, and higher earnings potential in adulthood. Reducing these inequities to access to higher education or other further educational pursuits is a key element to public health policy.\n\n\nMore on the results\n\n Below shows the chi-square tests applied to the contingency tables collated together:\n\n\n\n\nquestion\nx^2\np.value\n\n\n\n\neducation\n51.56\n0.00\n\n\njob\n4.46\n0.11\n\n\ntraining\n2.62\n0.27\n\n\nfamily\n2.01\n0.37\n\n\nunsure\n1.69\n0.43\n\n\nother\n2.01\n0.37\n\n\n\n\nA p.value of less than 0.05 indicates statistical significance, and that there is a relationship between the student’s status of being looked after and the specific prospect response.\nA chi-squared test is a simple nonparametric test which only tells us of an association if statistical significance is found.
