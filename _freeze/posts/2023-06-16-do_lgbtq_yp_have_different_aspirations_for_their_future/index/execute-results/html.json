This could influence their decision-making around aspirations after leaving school, such as their career, education, or training. This brief analysis seeks to ascertain whether a student's sexual orientation has a relationship with their aspirations after school.\n\n\n\n|answer                   | number|    %|\n|:------------------------|------:|----:|\n|Gay, lesbian or bisexual |   1035|  9.3|\n|Heterosexual/Straight    |   8445| 75.7|\n|Other                    |    235|  2.1|\n|Prefer not to say        |    660|  5.9|\n|Undecided/Questioning    |    665|  6.0|\n\n\n: Summary count of students on question asking about sexual orientation in YPHWS {#tbl-summary-count}\n\nThe above table displays the proportion of responses around sexual orientation in YPHWS. *Heterosexual/straight* students make up just over 3/4 of the total responses, followed by *gay, lesbian, or bisexual* at just under 10%. Smaller proportions ticked options *other*, *undecided/questioning*, and *prefer not to say*.\n\nHere, we identify that a student's ssexual orientation has a very statistically significant relationship with continuing education, but with no statistical significance with any of the other pathways after school.\n\n## Methods\n\nOne of the questions coded in the YPHWS survey is ***what do you plan to do as a next step after leaving school?*** This is a multi-factorial answer, where students can respond either *yes, no, or maybe* to several options:\n\n-   Education\n\n-   Job\n\n-   Training\n\n-   Family\n\n-   Uncertain\n\n-   Other\n\nWe performed a chi-squared test for each of the different prospects questions on the tables below for each of the responses, along with their relative proportions. Note, these numbers have been suppressed to the nearest 5 to prevent disclosure, but the actual chi-squared tests have been performed on the raw numbers.\n\nFor the purposes of this analysis, students who answered *undecided/questioning* and *other* are grouped together with students who answered *gay, lesbian or bisexual*. Students who answered *prefer not to say* were excluded, owing to the large difference in responses between this category and the other relevant categories.\n\n<details>\n\n<br>\n\n<summary>More on chi-squared tests</summary>\n\nWe can put the results of students answering the question in YPHWS in a contingency table, which tallies the responses into a table like:\n\n| Care-experienced | Maybe | No  | Yes |\n|------------------|-------|-----|-----|\n| Yes              |       |     |     |\n| Maybe            |       |     |     |\n| No               |       |     |     |\n\nWith contingency tables, we can perform chi-square tests, which examines whether the categories of the rows and columns of a contingency table are statistically significantly associated.\n\nThe chi-squared test compares the observed frequencies from the data with expected frequencies if there were null or no relationship between the variables.\n\nWith chi-squared tests, we need sufficient size in each of the cells inside the table. While the number of students not care-experienced outnumber the number of students who answered prefer not to say or yes, there are still sufficient numbers to perform the test (\\>5) in each of the responses.\n\nAfter the critical chi-squared test value is calculated, we then use the degrees of freedom to match the results on a distribution table with a significance threshold to determine statistical significance, usually set at 0.05.

Further analyses can be performed to elucidate further details on *how* or *why* the relationship between a student's sexual orientation affects their decision for pursuing a job after leaving school, training, and uncertainty with what to do, but these are beyond the scope of this report.\n\n</details>\n\n## Sub-analysis on transgender students\n\nThe crux of this analysis focuses on the sexual orientation of students, what is separate from that of biological sex. For the 2022 release of YPHWS, the survey refined the question on biological sex to one around gender identity, which expanded the number of options available, allowing students to tick non-binary and transgender as responses.\n",
