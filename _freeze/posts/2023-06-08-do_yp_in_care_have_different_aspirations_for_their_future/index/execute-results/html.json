This could influence their decision-making around aspirations after leaving school, such as their career, education, or training. This brief analysis seeks to ascertain whether a student's care status has a relationship with their aspirations after school.\n\nIn the data collected for the latest YPHWS cohort, there were 255 students out of a total of 11151 students who are care-experienced CYPs, representing 2.3% of the total student population.\n\nHere, we identify that the students being looked after status has a statistically significant relationship with having other plans after leaving school and with starting a family (a p-value of less than 0.05), very statistically significant (a p-value of less than 0.01) with continuing education, and no significance with undertaking further skilled training, pursuing a job or with being uncertain about what to do after leaving school.\n\n## Chi-squared Test\n\nOne of the questions coded in the YPHWS survey is ***what do you plan to do as a next step after leaving school?*** This is a multi-factorial answer, where students can respond either *yes, no, or maybe* to several options:\n\n-   Education\n\n-   Job\n\n-   Training\n\n-   Family\n\n-   Uncertain\n\n-   Other\n\nWe can put these results in a contingency table, which tallies the responses into a table like:\n\n| Care-experienced | Maybe | No  | Yes |\n|------------------|-------|-----|-----|\n| Yes              |       |     |     |\n| Maybe            |       |     |     |\n| No               |       |     |     |\n\nWith contingency tables, we can perform chi-square tests, which examines whether the categories of the rows and columns of a contingency table are statistically significantly associated.\n\nWe performed this test for each of the different prospects questions on the tables below for each of the responses, along with their relative proportions. Note, these numbers have been suppressed to the nearest 5 to prevent disclosure, but the actual chi-squared tests have been performed on the raw numbers.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>More on the Methodology</summary>\n\nThe chi-squared test compares the observed frequencies from the data with expected frequencies if there were no relationship between the variables.\n\nWith chi-squared tests, we need sufficient size in each of the cells inside the table. While the number of students not in care vastly outnumber the number of students who answered prefer not to sayÂ or no, there are still sufficient numbers to perform the test (\\>5) in each of the responses.\n\n</details>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Chi-squared Test Results\n\n::: {#tbl-panel-1 layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n\n\n|                  | Maybe|   No|

status of being looked after and the specific prospect response. Here, we identify that the students being looked after status has a statistically significant relationship with having other plans after leaving school, and with starting a family, very statistically significant with continuing education, and no significance with undertaking further skilled training, pursuing a job or with being uncertain about what to do after leaving school.\n\nA chi-squared test is a simple nonparametric test which only tells us of an association if statistical significance is found. Further analyses can be performed to elucidate further details on *how* or *why* the relationship between a children being looked after affects their prospective choices after education, but these are beyond the scope of this report.\n",
