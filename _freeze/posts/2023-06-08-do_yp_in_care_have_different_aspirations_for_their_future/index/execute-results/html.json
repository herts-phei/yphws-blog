This could influence their decision-making around aspirations after leaving school, such as their career, education, or training. This brief analysis seeks to ascertain whether a student's care status has a relationship with their aspirations after school.\n\n## Descriptive Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nIn the data collected for the latest YPHWS cohort, there were 254 students out of a total of 11151 students, representing 2.3% of the total student population.\n\n## Chi-squared Test\n\nOne of the questions coded in the YPHWS survey is *what do you plan to do as a next step after leaving school?* This is a multi-factorial answer, where students can answer either *yes, no, or maybe* to several responses:\n\n-   Education\n\n-   Job\n\n-   Training\n\n-   Family\n\n-   Uncertain\n\n-   Other\n\nWe can put these results in a contingency table, which tallies the responses into a table like:\n\n| Child Looked After | Maybe | No  | Yes |\n|--------------------|-------|-----|-----|\n| Yes                |       |     |     |\n| Maybe              |       |     |     |\n| No                 |       |     |     |\n\nWith contingency tables, we can perform chi-square tests, which examines whether the categories of the rows and columns of a contingency table are statistically significantly associated. The test compares the observed frequencies from the data with expected frequencies if there were no relationship between the variables.\n\nWith chi-squared tests, we need sufficient size in each of the cells inside the table. While the number of students not in care vastly outnumber the number of students who answered prefer not to sayÂ or *no*, there are still sufficient numbers to perform the test (\\>5) in each of the responses.\n\nWe can perform this test for each of the different prospects questions. The below shows the tables for each of the responses, along with their relative proportions row-wise. Note, these numbers have been suppressed to the nearest 5 to prevent disclose, but the actual chi-squared tests are performed on the raw numbers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {#tbl-panel layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n\n|                  | Maybe|   No|   Yes|\n|:-----------------|-----:|----:|-----:|\n|No                | 12090| 2900| 33000|\n|Prefer not to say |   255|  145|   435|\n|Yes               |   260|  195|   630|\n\n\n: Numbers (suppressed) {#tbl-first}\n\n\n\n|                  | Maybe|   No|  Yes|\n|:-----------------|-----:|----:|----:|\n|No                |  0.25| 0.06| 0.69|\n|Prefer not to say |  0.31| 0.17| 0.52|\n|Yes               |  0.24| 0.18| 0.58|\n\n\n: Proportions {#tbl-second}\n\nPlan to continue in education after leaving school\n:::\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n\n|                  | Maybe|   No|   Yes|\n|:-----------------|-----:|----:|-----:|\n|No                | 13870| 3860| 29000|\n|Prefer not to say |   225|  105|   540|\n|Yes               |   355|  120|   595|\n\n\n: Numbers (suppressed) {#tbl-first}\n\n\n\n|                  | Maybe|   No|  Yes|\n|:-----------------|-----:|----:|----:|\n|No                |  0.30| 0.08| 0.62|\n|Prefer not to say |  0.26| 0.12| 0.62|\n|Yes               |  0.33| 0.11| 0.56|\n\n\n: Proportions {#tbl-second}\n\nPlan to get a job after leaving school\n:::\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n\n|                  | Maybe|    No|   Yes|\n|:-----------------|-----:|-----:|-----:|\n|No                | 19620| 10480| 15085|\n|Prefer not to say |   305|   195|   350|\n|Yes               |   430|   295|   330|\n\n\n: Numbers (suppressed) {#tbl-first}\n\n\n\n|                  | Maybe|   No|  Yes|\n|:-----------------|-----:|----:|----:|\n|No                |  0.43| 0.23| 0.33|\n|Prefer not to say |  0.36| 0.23| 0.41|\n|Yes               |  0.41| 0.28| 0.31|\n\n\n: Proportions {#tbl-second}\n\nPlan to training for a skilled job after leaving school\n:::\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n\n|                  | Maybe|    No|  Yes|\n|:-----------------|-----:|-----:|----:|\n|No                | 15465| 18380| 8385|\n|Prefer not to say |   325|   240|  225|\n|Yes               |   330|   445|  235|\n\n\n: Numbers (suppressed) {#tbl-first}\n\n\n\n|                  | Maybe|   No|  Yes|\n|:-----------------|-----:|----:|----:|\n|No                |  0.37| 0.44| 0.20|\n|Prefer not to say |  0.41| 0.30| 0.28|\n|Yes               |  0.33| 0.44| 0.23|\n\n\n: Proportions {#tbl-second}\n\nPlan to start a family after leaving school\n:::\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n\n|                  | Maybe|    No|   Yes|\n|:-----------------|-----:|-----:|-----:|\n|No                | 11900| 18160| 13215|\n|Prefer not to say |   205|   340|   250|\n|Yes               |   255|   470|   285|\n\n\n: Numbers (suppressed) {#tbl-first}\n\n\n\n|                  | Maybe|   No|  Yes|\n|:-----------------|-----:|----:|----:|\n|No                |  0.27| 0.42| 0.31|\n|Prefer not to say |  0.26| 0.43| 0.31|\n|Yes               |  0.25| 0.47| 0.28|\n\n\n: Proportions {#tbl-second}\n\nAren't sure what they want to do after leaving school\n:::\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n\n|                  | Maybe|    No|  Yes|\n|:-----------------|-----:|-----:|----:|\n|No                | 15465| 18380| 8385|\n|Prefer not to say |   325|   240|  225|\n|Yes               |   330|   445|  235|\n\n\n: Numbers (suppressed) {#tbl-first}\n\n\n\n|                  | Maybe|   No|  Yes|\n|:-----------------|-----:|----:|----:|\n|No                |  0.37| 0.44| 0.20|\n|Prefer not to say |  0.41| 0.30| 0.28|\n|Yes               |  0.33| 0.44| 0.23|\n\n\n: Proportions {#tbl-second}\n\nHave other plans after leaving school\n:::\n\nBelow shows the chi-square tests applied applied to the contingency tables:\n\n## Chi-Squared Test Results\n\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|question  |       x^2| p.value|\n|:---------|---------:|-------:|\n|education | 89.512592|    0.00|\n|job       |  8.170609|    0.09|\n|training  |  7.857467|    0.10|\n|family    | 14.740377|    0.01|\n|unsure    |  1.915559|    0.75|\n|other     | 14.740377|    0.01|\n:::\n\n\nA p.value of less than 0.05 indicates statistical significance, and that there is a relationship between the student's status of being looked after and the specific prospect response. Here, we identify that the students being looked after status has a statistically significant relationship with having other plans after leaving school, and with starting a family, very statistically significant (a p-value of less than 0.01) with continuing education, and no significance with undertaking further skilled training or with being uncertain about what to do after leaving school.\n\nA chi-squared test is a simple nonparametric test which only tells us of an association if statistical significance is found. Further analyses can be performed to elucidate further details on *how* or *why* the relationship between a children being looked after affects their prospective choices after education.\n",
