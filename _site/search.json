    "text": "This blog website provides short reports on analysis done around the Young People’s Health and Well-being Survey (YPHWS), a youth health and wellbeing survey which gathers self-reported information annually from those aged 11-19 in Hertfordshire. The survey in a funded by Hertfordshire County Council’s Public Health and Services for Young People teams and is run by the Public Health Evidence & Intelligence Team.\nWe aim to release these reports iteratively over time.\nSome of the initial questions we aim to tackle include, but are not limited to:\n\nDo young people in care have less healthy diets than those not in care?\nDo young people in care have worse awareness of MH services than those not in care?\nDo LGBTQ+ YP have different aspirations for their future?\nDo YP in care have different aspirations for their future?\nDo LGBTQ+ YP feel different about sustainability?\nDo LGBTQ+ YP have different experiences in relation to safety and crime?\nAre YP who take drugs more likely to have MH conditions?\nAre those with disabilities supported by their schools and do they have different aspirations?\nIs self-perceived weight associated with poorer diet and lower exercise?\nAre more deprived YP more likely to smoke and vape? How do diet, self perceived weight, activity correlate with NCMP at a school level\n\n\nWhat’s New?\n\n2023-06-15 - Do YP in care have different aspirations for their future?"

    "text": "Chi-squared test\nOne of the questions coded in the YPHWS survey is what do you plan to do as a next step after leaving school? This is a multi-factorial answer, where students can answer either yes, no, or maybe to several responses. We can put these results in a contingency table, which tallies the responses into a table like:\n\n\n\nChild Looked After\nMaybe\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith contingency tables, we can perform chi-square tests, which examines whether the categories of the rows and columns of a contingency table are statistically significantly associated. The test compares the observed frequencies from the data with expected frequencies if there was no relationship between the variables.\nWith chi-squared tests, we need sufficient size in each of the cells inside the table. While the number of students not in care vastly outnumber the number of students who answered maybe or no, there are still sufficient numbers to perform the test (>5).\nWe can perform this test for each of the different prospects questions.
